## Editor Shortcuts

There are numerous shortcuts that make the editor quicker to use. This section pertains to what those shortcuts are and how to use them. The hotkeys associated with actions mentioned here can be located and rebound in the sidebar settings.

*Note: "Ctrl/Cmd" is often used to denote **Ctrl** for windows/linux computers and **Cmd** for mac computers.*

### Editing

These are a few general hotkeys that are overall helpful when using the editor.

- The editor tools available can be switched between using their corresponding hotkeys. Each tool and its associated hotkey are as follows: Pencil Tool (**Q**), Line Tool (**W**), Eraser (**E**), Select (**S**), Pan Tool (**R**), and Zoom Tool (**T**).
- **Mouse Scroll** can be used to zoom in and out, and dragging while holding **Right Click** can be used to pan across the track.
- The **Shift** key while using the line or pencil tools draws lines flipped over.
- When editing a particular node of a line, the **A** key can be used to lock the angle of that line, and the **Alt** key can be used to prevent the node from snapping to other line nodes.
- Like most editors, changes can be undone with **Ctrl/Cmd + Z** and redone with **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z**.

### Timeline Navigation

Navigating the timeline to a specific point quickly is useful for editing specific sections of the track. Below are some of the shortcuts for timeline navigating.

- Like most video previewers and editors, **Space** can be used to play and pause the track.
- **Period** (.) can be held to fast-forward the track. When using it while the track is pause, it plays the track at 1x speed, so you can preview the current part without having to tap play, then tap pause. While the track is playing, it speeds up the track to 2x speed.
- **Comma** (,) can be held to rewind the track. Similar to fast-forward, holding it while the track is paused rewinds at 1x speed, whereas rewinding while the track is playing rewinds at 2x speed.
- The **Right Arrow** and **Left Arrow** keys can be pressed to advance and go back a frame, respectively. If in smooth playback, these will go to the next or previous closest physics frame, which is 1/40th of a second. This is useful for seeing specific frames once at a specific section.

### Previewing

Along with navigating the timeline, there are also some shortcuts for previewing particular track sections.

- The **I** key can be used to place a flag at the current point in the timeline, which is helpful for marking off a section of track.
- Once a flag has been place, the **U** key can be used to stop the track and rewind it back to where the flag is located.
- The **Y** key is similar to the stop shortcut, but plays the track from the point the flag is at.
- The **O** key can be pressed to toggle "Onion Skinning," which shows where the rider(s) are in the next and previous few frames.

### Editing Line Selections

The following are some nice shortcuts for editing selections of lines.

- Lines can be added to a selection by holding **Shift** while selecting, and can be removed by holding **Ctrl/Cmd** while selecting.
- The line type of each line in a selection can be changed with **Alt + 1/2/3**, where **1** corresponds to blue, **2** corresponds to red, and **3** corresponds to green.
- In addition, each line in the selection can be flipped with **Alt + F**.
- A selection can also be nudged with hotkeys. For large nudges, the key combination **Alt + W/A/S/D** can be used to move lines up/left/down/right, respectively. Similarly, smaller nudges can be achieved using **Alt + Shift + W/A/S/D**.

### Cloning Lines

Finally, some helpful shortcuts for cloning selections of lines can be found below.

- Similar to most editors, selections of lines can be copied with **Ctrl/Cmd + C** and pasted with **Ctrl/Cmd + V**.
- Lines can also be duplicated with **Ctrl/Cmd + D**. This copy and pastes a selection in the same location while preserving layers.
- JSON Data of lines can also be copied using **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + C** and pasted with **Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + V**. This is especially useful for copying and pasting lines across track files.
