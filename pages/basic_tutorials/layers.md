## Layers

This is the layer menu icon, which can be found in the top right corner of the editor. Press this to open the layer menu.

There are two modes within the layer menu: edit mode and view mode. View mode allows you to edit the color, toggle the visibility, and lock the lines of each layer.

Edit mode, however, allows you to add, remove, or rename layers, as well as change the order in which layers get rendered.
