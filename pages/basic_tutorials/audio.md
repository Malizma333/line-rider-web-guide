This is the audio field, where music or other audio files can be loaded to play over the track.

You can load audio of any supported format, such as mp3 or ogg. When loading an audio file, these are the settings presented.

The enable slider can toggle the audio, where disabling the audio is the same as setting the volume slider to 0. The volume setting controls how loud the audio plays, and the offset setting controls at what point the audio starts playing from. A negative offset starts the audio at some point in the middle, while a positive offset adds some delay before the audio starts.
