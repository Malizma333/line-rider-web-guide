Linerider.com uses userscripts as the primary method of supporting mods. The following tutorial will walk through how to set up a userscript manager and install userscript mods.

### Downloading Userscripts

1) Install a userscript manager supported by your browser. There are multiple options available, but this guide recommends [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/). This will allow mods to run during a linerider.com browser instance.

2) Choose any number of mods to install. Mods can be found at the GitHub repositories listed [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/userscripts/repos.md %}). To install mods, navigate to their respective github page, click "Raw," then follow the Tampermonkey prompt to install.
