## About

Welcome to the official Line Rider web guide! This site is meant to host tutorials and resources related to the web edition of line rider, which can be found at [www.linerider.com](https://www.linerider.com/) (also accessible from the link in the top right).

### Background

In the past, many resources for the more obscure and advanced line rider web features have been shared as google docs, created as youtube videos, or scattered in discord posts. While these resources are useful, they lack accessibility. It's unclear where to begin searching for a particular topic, and even if a resource had been seen before, it was often difficult to remember where it originated from. The existence of this site is an attempt to remedy these difficulties.

This page was created using static site generation from markdown files using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs){:target="_blank"}. This was done in effort to make contributions easy and encourage maintainability in the long term, but include ease of navigation and search capabilities unavailable in sites like google docs. By keeping this project open source, I hope to see alternative aspects of line rider be explained more in depth on similarly hosted sites.

### Navigation

Navigation is made easy with the search feature, just click on the search bar at the top or press the keybind `Ctrl/Cmd + F` to begin searching for topics. A good place to get started is the [quickstart page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/quickstart.md %}), which demonstrates the essential features of line rider web needed to create your first track.

For developers, the separate [developer site](https://malizma333.github.io/line-rider-web-docs/){:target="_blank"} goes more in detail about API features useful for developing mods and external tools.

Contributing to this page is currently only available through the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Malizma333/line-rider-web-guide/){:target="_blank"}, which requires having a GitHub account and creating a separate branch to make changes. This process may be amended in the future to be more user-friendly.
