## About

This is the repository of the official guide for the web edition of Line Rider, maintained by @Malizma333.

## Contributing

Contributing is only available to those with a GitHub account and access to git. To contribute, simply create a separate branch to make changes on, and open up a pull request. For less frequent users of GitHub, the following instructions go more in detail about how to do this.

### Creating the Branch

1) Go to the `Branches` view located near the top of this repository page.
